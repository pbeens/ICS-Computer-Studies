# ICS3C-Final-Project-2019

## Overview

Each heading below will be as the handin folder for you to hand in your project.

A video walk-through will have to be done after the project is all coded.

Use appropriate and numerous comments throughout your code.

Be sure all varaiable names are appropriate and self-explanatory.

Use your own functions where it makes sense for "chunking" your code. See these videos for tutorials on writing your own functions: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBo2D3Myo6Q) | [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_XyeWg_3EE)

Be sure your program follows these style and variable naming guidelines:

## Program 01 - Bouncing Ball

Write a program where the ball is bouncing around the screen.

Be sure the speed of the ball can be controlled with a global variable.

Be sure the size of the window can be set with global variables `window_height` and `window_width`.

The background colour of the window is to be set globally with the variable `background_colour`.

The colour of the ball is to be set globally with the variable `ball_colour`.

The size of the ball is to be set gloabally with the variable `ball_size`.

Be sure the program meets the needs addressed in the overview, above.

## Program 02 - Moveable Paddle

Write a program with a moveable paddle on the right side of the screen.

Continue using these global variables as defined above:

+ `window_height`
+ `window_width`
+ `background_colour`

The paddle position is to be controlled with the mouse y position.

The width of the paddle is to be set globally with the variable `paddle_width` and is to be set to 5% of the window width.

The height of the paddle is to be set globally with the variable `paddle_height` and is to be set to 15% of the window height.

Be sure the program continues to meet the needs addressed in the overview, above.

## Program 03 - Working Paddle

Combine both programs above so you have a working Pong game, with your paddle (on the right) working to bounce the ball and the wall on the left working to also bounce the ball.

Continue using all the global variables mentioned above.

Be sure the program continues to meet the needs addressed in the overview, above.

## Program 04 - Second Paddle (DRAFT)

- computer-controlled paddle on left
- compensate for ball width
