## Course Expectations

### ICS4U

- A1.5 describe and use one-dimensional arrays of compound data types (e.g., objects, structures, records) in a computer program.
- C1.1 decompose a problem into modules, classes, or abstract data types (e.g., stack, queue, dictionary) using an object-oriented design methodology (e.g., CRC [Class Responsibility Collaborator] or UML [Unified Modeling Language]);

## Learning Goals

- We will write simple programs that demonstration how to *instantiate* (create) objects.
- We will write simple programs that include methods (aka functions) that allow us to manipulate and/or report on the properties of an object
- We will deconstruct a business case where objects will have to be created in our program
