# Python Objects Lesson

*Note: Be sure all programs are all well-documented with their purpose. Include URLS where appropriate.* 

## Course Expectations
### ICS4U
- A1.5 describe and use one-dimensional arrays of compound data types (e.g., objects, structures, records) in a computer program.
- C1.1 decompose a problem into modules, classes, or abstract data types (e.g., stack, queue, dictionary) using an object-oriented design methodology (e.g., CRC [Class Responsibility Collaborator] or UML [Unified Modeling Language]);

## Learning Goals

- We will write simple programs that demonstration how to *instantiate* (create) objects.
- We will write simple programs that include methods (aka funtions) that allow us to manipulate and/or report on the properties of an object
- We will deconstruct a business case where objects will have to be created in our program

## Assignment - Part 1
Watch and recreate this tutorial:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POQIIKb1BZA

Save and submit the demo program:
- ememy_1.py (note the numbering)

Add and test at least one appropriate method (function) to the Enemy class. Save and submit as:

- enemy_2.py (note the numbering)

A handin folder will be created when I return.

*Handin folder: Python Objects*

## Assignment - Part 2
Watch the followup video:

Recreate and submit the two demo programs:
- tuna_with_init.py
- ememy_with_init.py
