# Final Project - Python Students

## Big Picture

For ICS4U students, you will have to program and demonstrate one (1) "C" level question from the DSBN programming competitions. Optionally, you can program and demonstrate two (2) "B" level questions with a penalty of 20% or three (3) "A" level questions with a penalty of 40%.

For ICS3U students, you will have to program and demonstrate one (1) "B" level question and one (1) "A" level question from the DSBN programming competitions. Optionally, you can program and demonstrate four (4) "A" level questions with a penalty of 20% or three (3) "A" level questions with a penalty of 40%.

## Colaboratory (Jupyter Notebook)

The programs will be coded in [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) using [this template](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-h3pZn6n9_F7WdI6hhyQnKGmXOLPVfyM). 

## Code Walk-through

When the programs are finished, you will have to do a video "code walk-through" using [Screencastify](https://www.screencastify.com/) or any other similar screen-recording software for each program.

For an example of an excellent code walk-through, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6U3rw-cH6A).
