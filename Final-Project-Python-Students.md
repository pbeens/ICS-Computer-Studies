## 1. Big Picture

For ICS4U students, you will have to program and demonstrate one (1) "C" level question from the DSBN programming competitions. Optionally, you can program and demonstrate two (2) "B" level questions with a penalty of 20% or three (3) "A" level questions with a penalty of 40%.

For ICS3U students, you will have to program and demonstrate one (1) "B" level question and one (1) "A" level question from the DSBN programming competitions. Optionally, you can program and demonstrate four (4) "A" level questions with a penalty of 20% or three (3) "A" level questions with a penalty of 40%.

## 2. Challenge Locations

The programming challenges you can choose from can be viewed [here](https://sites.google.com/view/programmingchallenges/dsbn).

## 3. Challenge Requests

Submit your challenge requests [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdLh5OX3HC2M1iFOtq3RjaigIqT70_QDJk-AhXC_xHzt0-unA/viewform).

The Google Sheet with the challenges that have already been requested can be viewed [here](http://bit.ly/2HEC3eQ). Remember that it's first-come-first-served. 

## 4. Data Files

Data files for each of the challenges (if available) can be accessed from [here](https://github.com/pbeens/CS-Challenge-Data-Files). See this [program stub](https://github.com/pbeens/CS-Challenge-Data-Files/blob/master/Python-Stub.py) for how to access the files from online.

## 5. Colaboratory (Jupyter Notebook)

The programs will be coded in [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) using [this template](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-h3pZn6n9_F7WdI6hhyQnKGmXOLPVfyM).

Share each Colab document with your instructor when you create it (after renaming).

## 6. Code Walk-through

When the programs are finished, you will have to do a video "code walk-through" using [Screencastify](https://www.screencastify.com/) or any other similar screen-recording software for each program.

For an example of an excellent code walk-through, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6U3rw-cH6A).

## 7. Function Docstrings

See https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/docstrings-python#second-head for the requirements for the function docstrings.

Docstrings MUST be incorporated into all functions to describe the purpose of the function and to accurately document all inputs and return value.

## 8. What You Must Do To Earn Top Marks (DRAFT)

- Submit your notebook via GitHub *daily* (10%$^{1}$)
- Ensure there is a suitable Commit Comment for each commit (5%)
- Ensure the journal at the top of the notebook is completed accurately daily and has suitable, detailed comments (10%)
- Ensure there is *extensive* internal documentation, done as text blocks to supplement any internal, more minor comments (10%)
- Ensure each function has suitable and working docstrings (10%)
- Ensure you have created a clear, descriptive code walk-through video (or videos) and submitted it/them via Classroom (20%)

$^{1}$ Designates maximum deduction for not satisfying this criterion.

## 9. Submissions

You will be submitting the Colab notebooks and each video. Be sure the notebook and the videos are named appropriately.
